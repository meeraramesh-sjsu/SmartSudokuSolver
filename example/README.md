The aim of this project is to develop a Smart Sudoku Solver. 
It is developed using the LWM2M(Light weight machine to machine) model.
The client is a android app and the 3x3 sudoku board is obtained from the user using voice and the output from the server is converted to speech
and the speaker says it.

The four interfaces such as bootstrap, client registration, device management and service enablement and information reporting have been developed.
This repository contains the Server code-base, the device-management and service enablement operations of the client.
